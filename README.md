# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Team Collaboration & Backend Data

This application currently uses `localStorage` for data persistence, making it suitable for individual use. To enable team collaboration where multiple users can access and modify shared task data, the following architectural changes would be necessary:

1.  **Backend Database**: Implement a backend database solution. Firebase Firestore is a highly recommended option for real-time data synchronization and scalability.
    *   **Data Modeling**: Define data structures for tasks, assignees, and potentially users/teams within Firestore.
    *   **Data Migration**: Existing `localStorage` data handling would be replaced with Firestore SDK calls (queries, writes, updates, deletes).

2.  **User Authentication**: Integrate an authentication system, such as Firebase Authentication, to manage user identities and control access to data.

3.  **Server Actions/API Endpoints**: Refactor data operations to use Next.js Server Actions (as initiated in `src/app/actions.ts`) or dedicated API endpoints. These server-side functions would securely interact with the backend database.

4.  **Real-time Updates**: Leverage Firestore's real-time listeners to ensure all connected clients see data changes instantly, enhancing the collaborative experience.

The server action stubs added in `src/app/actions.ts` are a first step towards centralizing data logic on the server, preparing for integration with a backend like Firebase.
